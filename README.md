# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning
# Description
### A 100 Day ML Challenge to learn and implement ML/DL concepts ranging from the very basics of Machine Learning to advanced Deep Learning.
## DAY 0 [15/01/2022] Introduction
* What is Machine Learning? 
* Scenerios where machine learning is most important.
* How is it diffrent from Conventional programming?
* Started [Andrew NG's Machine Learning by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) Course on Cousera.
## DAY 1 [16/01/2022] AI,ML and DL
* Diffrence between AI, ML and DL.
* Why ML and DL came into existnece.
* How does all three domains are different from each other?
## DAY 2 [17/01/2022] Types of Machine Learning
* Got to know different types on the basis of amount of supervision needed for ML algorithm to get trained.
## DAY 3 [18/01/2022] Online Vs Offline ML
